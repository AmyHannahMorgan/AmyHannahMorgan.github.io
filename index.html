<h1>Hello World</h1>

<p>
  <img id="profileImage" src="/assets/photos/me_irl.jpg" alt="">
  My name is Amy, I'm primarily a programer with some basic knowledge of Javascript, Python and some C#. I also have an interest and experience in graphic design and computer repair as well as a good amount of experience with many productivity applications such as the Microsoft Office suite, especially Access and Excel.

  In addition I also have some experience with technologies such as Node.js and React, however this experience is limited and I plan to expand my knowledge on these technologies in the future to gain experience of full-stack web development.

  I was born in and grew up in south Wales. I became interested in computers from a very young age when I received my first PC, an old, beige, Windows 95 machine. My interest in gaming also started at this time after I received a copy of Mechwarrior 3 from a family friend.

  After leaving comprehensive with average to below average grades I was enrolled on a work based training course. I worked at a community project that refurbished bikes and sold them to the community as well as assisting vulnerable young people to develop their skills and gain qualifications. This is where I gained my interest and experience in graphic design as well as gaining more experience with computers and computer repair after I was tasked with creating marketing and other visual materials for the project in addition to maintaining some of the computers on site.

  I then enrolled in college in hopes of gaining a level 3 qualification in IT in order to either find a career in the IT industry or to progress to a computer science course at university. In hopes of pursuing a career in software development or machine learning and AI.

  I'm typically a quiet and introverted person whos happy to get on with their work independently however I am more than capable of working in a group/team. While I enjoy socialising I often don't initiate conversation although I am happy to socialise with pretty much anyone provided they approach me.
