<h1>Hello World</h1>

<p>
  <img id="profileImage" src="/assets/photos/me_irl.jpg" alt="">
  My name is Amy, I'm primarily a programer with some basic knowledge of Javascript, Python and some C#. I also have an interest and experience in graphic design and computer repair as well as a good amount of experience with many productivity applications such as the Microsoft Office suite, especially Access and Excel.

  In addition I also have some experience with technologies such as Node.js and React, however this experience is limited and I plan to expand my knowledge on these technologies in the future to gain experience of full-stack web development.

<h1 id="introduction">~$ whoami</h1>

<p>
  I was born in and grew up in south Wales. I became interested in computers from a very young age when I received my first PC, an old, beige, Windows 95 machine. My interest in gaming also started at this time after I received a copy of Mechwarrior 3 from a family friend.

  After leaving comprehensive with average to below average grades I was enrolled on a work based training course. I worked at a community project that refurbished bikes and sold them to the community as well as assisting vulnerable young people to develop their skills and gain qualifications. This is where I gained my interest and experience in graphic design as well as gaining more experience with computers and computer repair after I was tasked with creating marketing and other visual materials for the project in addition to maintaining some of the computers on site.

  I then enrolled in college in hopes of gaining a level 3 qualification in IT in order to either find a career in the IT industry or to progress to a computer science course at university. In hopes of pursuing a career in software development or machine learning and AI.

  I'm typically a quiet and introverted person whos happy to get on with their work independently however I am more than capable of working in a group/team. While I enjoy socialising I often don't initiate conversation although I am happy to socialise with pretty much anyone provided they approach me.

<h2>Gaming</h2>

<p>My interest in gaming began at a very early age after I received a copy of Mechwarrior 3. Following that I continued to develop my interest after I was given a Playstation 2 for Christmas. Over the course of my life I have owned multiple platforms including but not limited to the PS2, Xbox 360, Nintendo Wii, Nintendo DS and PC.

My favorite genres include RPGs, grand strategy games, first and third-person shooters, building and management games and puzzle games. Some of my favourite games and series include Warframe, The Elder Scrolls,  Fallout, Crusader Kings II, Cities: Skylines and Human Resource Machine.

<h2>Graphic Design</h2>

<p>I gained an interest in graphic design after working at a community project where I was tasked to create marketing and other visual materials for the project, including but not limited to price tags, marketing flyers/posters, leaflets and business cards. Since then I have been asked by friends and family to create resources for them to use as well as creating designs for my own personal use. While the quality of my work is by no means professional the designs that I have created have always met my needs or the needs of others.</p>

<h2>Programming</h2>

<p>My experience and interest in programming started when I began creating a small CYOA game in batch shortly before I progressed to comprehensive. Throughout comprehensive I experimented with programming on and off but I never created anything substantial, always stuck in tutorial purgatory.

In winter of 2017 I created my first somewhat substantial application, a Discord bot that assisted users in playing truth or dare, keeping track of players, dictating who was asking who and shuffling the player queue to ensure people were being asked and asking different players each round.

Throughout 2018 I experimented with Unity game development and created a couple of small games.
